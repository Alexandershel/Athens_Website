		The Acropolis is a citadel on a hill from Ancient Greece -approximately from the 5th century 
		BCE- and is the home to many notable buildings. The Acropolis of Athens grew throughout this
		century with influence from sculptors and Pericles, the Athenian statesman at the time. Athens 
		became a powerful city-state after the victory against the Persians and the establishment of 
		their democracy. The beautiful architecture was just another piece to the puzzle. With the 
		Parthenon, the Propylaia, and much more, the city of Athens continues to be a thriving tourist
		location with over 20 million people visiting every year.

		<! The Parthenon>
		<a name= "parthenon"> <b> <font size= +3> <font color= e6ecff> <p> The Parthenon </p> </font color> </font size> </b>
		<center> <a href = "" onclick = "return chngImg()">

		<font size= +1> <font color= 00004d> <p> The Parthenon was constructed by architects Ictinus and
		Callicrates, and sculptor Phidias. The temple is dedicated to the goddess Athena Parthenos, hence
		the name Parthenon. The Parthenon remained intact until the 5th century CE when the statue of
		colossal statue of Athena was removed and the temple was converted to a Christian church. In 1458,
		the temple was seized by the Turks and transformed into a mosque. Later, in 1687, a powder magazine
		blew up in the center of the Parthenon when the Venetians were fighting the Turks. Most of the
		base and structure is still intact. Most of the sculptures, unfortunately, were not saved. However,
		there are two replicas of the Parthenon: a full-size replica in Nashville, TN and replica made out
		of books in Germany.

		<! The Propylaia>
		<a name= "propylaia">
		<b> <font size= +3> <font color= e6ecff> <p> The Propylaia </p> </font color> </font size> </b>
		<img src= "prop.jpg" align= left width= 200 height= 140>
		<font size= +1> <font color= 00004d> <p align= left> This monument is the official entrance to Athens. 
		The architect, Mnesikles, started construction at the same time as the Parthenon. However, building
		was put on hold for 5 years due to the Peloponnesian War. It is a complex structure made to impress 
		visitors. Inside the building, the east room was home to mytholigic paintings and the west wing held
		bronze statues in the Hellenistic era. The Propylaia was crucial to building fortifications of the 
		citadel and was once a palace of the Franks.

		<! The Erechtheian>
		<a name= "erechtheion">
		<b> <font size= +3> <font color= e6ecff> <br> <p> The Erechtheion </p> </font color> </font size> </b>			
		<center> <img src="erech.jpg" name="adPicture" height= 250> </center>
		<font size= +1> <font color= 00004d> <p> The Erechtheion is a temple used for religious rituals. 
		Construction started in 420 BCE, but, like the Propylaia, was stopped midway to a major Athenian loss 
		in Syracuse. After this loss, Athens spiraled out-of-control: there were multiple revolts and their 
		democracy was replaced with an oligarchy. After this string of events, building ended in 406 BCE, and 
		just 3 years later, Athens would fall to Sparta. The Erechtheion is well designed around uneven 
		terraign and perviously standing shrines (ex. Erechtheus, the olive tree, the tomb of Kekrops, etc.) 
		A famous feature of this building are the Caryatids: a prostaseis (porch) supported by six female 
		statues. On the inside of the temple, "The east end of the Erechtheion was dedicated to Athena Polias 
		(protector of the earth and fertility) and housed the ultra-sacred wooden diipetes (fallen from the 
		heavens) xoano (statue) of Athena." Unfortunately, we can only guess what the interior looked like 
		because of its many renovations. The Erechtheion endured a fire, a conversion into a Christian basilica, 
		and a conversion into a harem.

		<! The Temple of Athena Nike>
		<a name= "temple">
		<b> <font size= +3> <font color= e6ecff> <p> The Temple of Athena Nike </p> </font color> </font size> </b>
		<iframe width="475" height="250" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgrLHs-g_PU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen align= left></iframe>
		<font size= +1> <font color= 00004d> <p align= left> The intial use of this temple was for the worship of deities 
		associated with wars. Over time, these "Nike" gods and goddesses fused with the cult of Athena Nike. In 
		a recent excavation, it was revealed that a pit existed so that Greeks used to pour libations and to 
		deposit figurines. The statue of Athena Nike housed in the temple was made of wood and it held a 
		pomegrade and a helmet. Fun Fact: this statue was referred to as the Apteros Nike because it had no 
		wings (which was custom of Nike statues). This way the statue could never leave the citadel. The same 
		year that the Parthenon was destroyed, the temple was dismantled: its stones were used to build a 
		bastion for the Turks. It wasn't until the liberation of Greece that the stones were returned.
